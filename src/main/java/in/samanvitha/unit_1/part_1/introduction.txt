Java is an Object oriented programming language
-Java was originally developed by Sun Microsystems
- By James Gosling
- Released in 1995 as the core component of Sun Microsystems

It has multiple editions
-Smart Cards
-Micro Edition
-Standard Edition
-Enterprise Edition

It follows a strict rule "Write Once, Run Anywhere"

There are many features also known as buzz words in java. They are
-Object Oriented
-Platform independent
-Simple
-Secure
-Architectural Neutral
-Portable
-Robust
-Multi-threaded
-Interpreted
-High-Performance
-Distributed
-Dynamic

Java undergoes 4 phases in the lifecycle
-Edit
-Compile
-Load
-Execute
Explanation:
Firstly any program in java is saved as .java
That program with the help of compiler is loaded and .class file is produced. It contains byte codes.
This class file is loaded by class loader into the memory.
With the help of Java Virtual Machine byte code is transferred by interpreter into machine language.
This byte code format can be executed in any system irrespective of their Operating Systems.

Since it is an Object Oriented Programming Language. It has the following concepts
-Encapsulation:
    Binding of data and object into a single unit is called encapsulation.
    Example Class contains both data members and member functions combined into a block
    Access specifiers - private
-Abstraction:
    It shows only the necessary objects to the client object.
    Access specifiers - public based on the perspective
-Inheritance:
    It exhibits the property of inheriting the properties of parent class to child class and extra properties can also be added to the child class.
    It has a 2 kinds of relationships(Is - a and Has - a).
    It supports single, multilevel, hierarchical inheritance
    It does not support multiple inheritance.
-Polymorphism:
    It means that having many forms.
    In detail a method with a same name can have different parameters.
    It is classified into 2 types:
    -Run time Polymorphism
        Overriding - Same method name implemented in different extended classes.
    -Compile time Polymorphism
        Overloading - Same method name with different parameters in the same class.

Access specifiers are classified into 4 types:
-Private
-Public
-Protected
-Default

Primitive Data Types:
Java prefers 8 types
-Logical
    boolean - true and false
-Textual
    char
    Represents a 16-bit unicode Character.
    It is represented in single quotes.
-Integral
    integer length    name       range
    8 bits            byte       -2^7 to 2^7-1
    16 bits           short      -2^15 to 2^15-1
    32 bits           int        -2^31 to 2^31-1
    64 bits           long       -2^63 to 2^63-1  (Ends with L or l)
-Floating point
    float
        -32 bits
        -Ends with F or f
    double
        -64 bits
        -Ends with D or d

Reference DataTypes:
-Reference variables are created using defined constructors of the classes.
-Class objects, and various type of array variables come under reference data type.
