ENUM
-An enum is a data type which contains fixed set of constants.
Ex:-It can be used for days of the week (SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY and SATURDAY)
-Enums can be thought of as classes that have fixed set of constants.

Features
-enum improves type safety and can be used in switch statements.
-enum can be traversed and can have fields, constructors and methods
-enum may implement many interfaces but cannot extend any class because it internally extends Enum class

-The enum constants have initial value that starts from 0, 1, 2, 3 and so on.
-But we can initialize the specific value to the enum constants by defining fields and constructors.
-Enum can have fields, constructors and methods
