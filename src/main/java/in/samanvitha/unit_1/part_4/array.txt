ARRAY
-An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
-The length of an array is established when the array is created.
-After creation, its length is fixed.
-Array is called from the stack and is stored in the heap memory.
-All array subscripts begin at 0.

Types of Array:
-One Dimensional
-Two Dimensional
-Multi dimensional

One Dimensional:
    datatype[] array_name;
Ex:-double[] myList = new double[10];

Two Dimensional:
Array of four arrays of five integers each:
    int[][] twoDim = new int[4][5];

Enhanced For Loops:
-The enhanced for loop has the following characteristics:
    Simplified iteration over collections
    Much shorter, clearer, and safer
    Effective for arrays
    Simpler when using nested loops
    Iterator disadvantages removed

Array Resizing:
-You cannot resize an array.
-You can use the same reference variable to refer to an entirely new array, such as:
    int[] myArray = new int[6];
    myArray = new int[10];

Copying Arrays
-The System.arraycopy() method to copy arrays
int[] myArray = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
int[] hold = { 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 };
System.arraycopy(myArray, 0, hold, 0, myArray.length);
