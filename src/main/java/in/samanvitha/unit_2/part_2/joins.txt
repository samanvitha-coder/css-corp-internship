SQL JOIN
    -SQL joins are used to query data from two or more tables,based on a relationship between certain columns in these tables.
    -The JOIN keyword is used in an SQL statement to query data from two  or more tables, based on a relationship between certain columns in these tables.
    -Tables in a database are often related to each other with keys.
    -A primary key is a column (or a combination of columns) with a unique value for each row. Each primary key value must be unique within the table. The purpose is to bind data together, across tables, without repeating all of the data in every table.

Different SQL JOINs
JOIN: Return rows when there is at least one match in both tables
LEFT JOIN: Return all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table
RIGHT JOIN: Return all rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table

SQL INNER JOIN Keyword
    The INNER JOIN keyword returns rows when there is at least one match in both tables.
    SQL INNER JOIN Syntax
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name1
    INNER JOIN table_name2
    ON table_name1.column_name=table_name2.column_name

SQL LEFT JOIN Keyword
    The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all rows from the left table (table_name1), even if there are no matches in the right table (table_name2).
    SQL LEFT JOIN Syntax
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name1
    LEFT JOIN table_name2
    ON table_name1.column_name=table_name2.column_name
    PS: In some databases LEFT JOIN is called LEFT OUTER JOIN.

SQL RIGHT JOIN Keyword
     The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all the rows from the right table (table_name2), even if there are no matches in the left table (table_name1).
     SQL RIGHT JOIN Syntax
     SELECT column_name(s)
     FROM table_name1
     RIGHT JOIN table_name2
     ON table_name1.column_name=table_name2.column_name
     PS: In some databases RIGHT JOIN is called RIGHT OUTER JOIN.

The SQL UNION Operator
    The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.
    Notice that each SELECT statement within the UNION must have the same number of columns. The columns must also have similar data types. Also, the columns in each SELECT statement must be in the same order.
    SQL UNION Syntax
    SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name1
    UNION
        SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name2
    Note: The UNION operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL.
    SQL UNION ALL Syntax
        SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name1
        UNION ALL
        SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name2

SQL CREATE VIEW Statement
    In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
    A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.
    You can add SQL functions, WHERE, and JOIN statements to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.
    SQL CREATE VIEW Syntax
    CREATE VIEW view_name AS
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition

SQL Updating a View
    You can update a view by using the following syntax:
    SQL CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Syntax
    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition

SQL Dropping a View
    You can delete a view with the DROP VIEW command.
    SQL DROP VIEW Syntax
    DROP VIEW view_name
